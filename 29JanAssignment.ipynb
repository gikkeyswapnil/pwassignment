    "### 1. Who developed Python Programming Language? \n",
    "* Ans : Guido van Rossum is the inventor of the Python programming language back in the late 1980s. Van Rossum was stuck with the Python project until 2018, when he took a permanent vacation from being the lead developer of the language. Since then, a Steering Council has been in charge of taking the language forward.\n"

    "* Ans : Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine. Python is different from major compiled languages, such as C and C + +, as Python code is not required to be built and linked like code for these languages."

    "### 6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?\n",
    "* Ans : A Python program is constructed from code blocks. A block is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit. The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition. Each command typed interactively is a block. A script file (a file given as standard input to the interpreter or specified as a command line argument to the interpreter) is a code block. A script command (a command specified on the interpreter command line with the -c option) is a code block. A module run as a top level script (as module __main__) from the command line using a -m argument is also a code block. The string argument passed to the built-in functions eval() and exec() is a code block.A code block is executed in an execution frame. A frame contains some administrative information (used for debugging) and determines where and how execution continues after the code block’s execution has completed."

    "* type( ) function : The type() function returns the type of the specified object\n",
    "* input( ) function : The input() function allows taking the input from the user.\n",
    "* abs( ) function : The abs() function returns the absolute value of the specified number.\n",
    "* pow( ) function : The pow() function returns the calculated value of x to the power of y i.e, xy.If a third parameter is present in this function, then it returns x to the powe\n",
    "* dir( ) function : The dir() function returns all the properties and methods of the specified object, without the values.This function even returns built-in properties which are the default for all objects.\n",
    "* sorted( ) function : The sorted() function returns a sorted list of the specified iterable object.You can specify the order to be either ascending or descending. In this function, Strings are sorted alphabetically, and numbers are sorted numerically.\n",
    "* max( ) function : The max() function returns the item with the maximum value or the item with the maximum value in an iterable.If the values this function takes are strings, then it is done using an alphabetical comparison\n",
    "* round( ) function : The round() function returns a floating-point number that is a rounded version of the specified number, with the specified number of decimals.The default number of decimals is 0, meaning that the function will return the nearest integer.\n",
    "* divmod( ) function : The divmod() function returns a tuple containing the quotient and the remainder when the first argument i.e, the dividend is divided by the second argument i.e, the divisor.\n",
    "* id( ) function : The id() function returns a unique id for the specified object. Note that all the objects in Python have their own unique id.The id is assigned to the object when it is created.The id is the object’s memory address and will be different for each time you run the program. (except for some object that has a constant unique id, like integers from -5 to 256)\n",
    "* ord( ) function : The ord() function returns the number representing the Unicode code of a specified character.\n",
    "* len( ) function : The len() function returns the count of items present in a specified object.When the object is a string, then the len() function returns the number of characters present in that string.\n",
    "* sum( ) function : The sum() function returns a number, the sum of all items in an iterable.\n",
    "* help( ) function : The help() function is used to display the documentation of modules, functions, classes, keywords, etc.If we don’t give an argument to the help function, then the interactive help utility starts up on the console.\n"

Another part of the memory is used for Python object such as int, dict, list, etc. CPython contains the object allocator that allocates memory within the object area. The object allocator gets a call every time the new object needs space."
