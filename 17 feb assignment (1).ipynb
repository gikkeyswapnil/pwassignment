    "### Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "### Ans :-\n",
    "   MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL (non-relational) document-oriented database system that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format known as    BSON (Binary JSON). It is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and is highly scalable and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Non-relational databases are a type of database management system (DBMS) that do not use traditional tables, rows, and columns to organize and        store data. Instead, they use a variety of data models, such as key-value stores, document stores, and graph databases, to store and access data.      Non-relational databases are often used when dealing with large amounts of unstructured data that cannot be easily organized into a traditional        table format.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   #### * MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "   \n",
    "  1) High scalability and flexibility are required:\n",
    "     MongoDB is highly scalable and can easily handle large volumes of data, making it a good choice for organizations with rapidly growing data            needs. Additionally, its flexible data model allows for easy adaptation to changing business needs.\n",
    "  2) Unstructured or semi-structured data is being stored: \n",
    "     MongoDB's document-based model is well-suited to storing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media posts, sensor data, or user-        generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3) Agile development: MongoDB is often used in Agile software development due to its flexible data model, which allows for rapid prototyping and          iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4) Cloud-based applications: MongoDB is well-suited for cloud-based applications, as it provides easy integration with cloud platforms like AWS and       Azure, and can be easily scaled up or down to meet changing demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5) Real-time analytics: MongoDB's built-in aggregation framework and MapReduce functions make it well-suited for real-time analytics and reporting."

    "### Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "### Ans :-\n",
    "  MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database system that offers a range of features designed to meet the needs of modern applications. Some   of the key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "  \n",
    " #### * Document-Oriented: \n",
    "   MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents that can have varying fields, making it a good fit for applications with evolving data needs.\n",
    "\n",
    " #### * Ad Hoc Queries:\n",
    "   MongoDB supports ad-hoc queries by indexing data for faster access, allowing users to quickly and easily retrieve data without         having to       define a schema or structure beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "  #### * Indexing: \n",
    "  MongoDB supports a variety of indexing types, including single-field, compound, geospatial, and text, to help improve query                     performance and speed up data access.\n",
    "\n",
    "  #### * Aggregation: \n",
    "  MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that can be used to group and analyze data, allowing for real-time analytics             and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * Load Balancing: \n",
    "   MongoDB's built-in sharding allows for horizontal scaling, distributing data across multiple servers to improve performance and handle larger data    volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * High Availability:\n",
    "   MongoDB supports replica sets, allowing for automatic failover in the event of a primary node failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * Atomic Operations:\n",
    "   MongoDB supports atomic operations at the document level, ensuring that operations on a single document are atomic, consistent, and isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * Flexible Schema: \n",
    "   MongoDB's flexible document-based schema allows for easier and faster changes to the database schema, reducing development time and allowing for      agile development practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * Rich Query Language:\n",
    "   MongoDB provides a rich query language with support for various operators, including comparison, logical, and regular expression operators, making    it easy to write complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * Document Validation: \n",
    "MongoDB allows users to define and enforce document validation rules, ensuring data quality and consistency across the           database."

    "### Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "* delete_one() method is used to delete a single document from a collection that matches a specified filter. If multiple documents match the filter, it will only delete the first document it finds.\n",
    "\n",
    "* delete_many() method is used to delete all documents from a collection that matches a specified filter. This method can be used to remove multiple documents at once.\n",
    "\n",
    " * drop() method is used to remove an entire collection from a database. It is more like deleting a table in SQL. Dropping a collection deletes all the documents and indexes associated with it.\n",
    " \n",
    " These methods are used for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the MongoDB database. It allows for selective deletion of documents, which can help to reduce the size of a collection and improve query performance. Deleting unused or unnecessary data from the database can also help to improve the overall performance of the system. Additionally, using the drop() method can be useful when you no longer need a collection or if you want to recreate it with a different schema. However, it is important to use these methods with caution, as they permanently delete data from the database, and there is no way to recover the data once it has been deleted."
