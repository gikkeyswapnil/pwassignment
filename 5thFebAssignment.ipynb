    "        A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state.\n",

    "### Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "##### Ans:\n",
    "* Inheritence : It is a mechanism that allows you to create a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class from another class. Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. \n",
    "* Encapsulation:  It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method.\n",
    "* Abstraction : Abstraction in python is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user. This is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages\n",
    "* Polymorphism : The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types. The key difference is the data types and number of arguments used in function"

    "#### Ans :\n",
    "*   self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self”  we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments.The reason you need to use self. is because Python does not use the @ syntax to refer to instance attributes. Python decided to do methods in a way that makes the instance to which the method belongs be passed automatically, but not received automatically: the first parameter of methods is the instance the method is called on."

    "### Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",

    "\n",
    "* In inheritance, the child class acquires the properties and can access all the data members and functions defined in the parent class. A child class can also provide its specific implementation to the functions of the parent class. In this section of the tutorial, we will discuss inheritance in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In python, a derived class can inherit base class by just mentioning the base in the bracket after the derived class name. Consider the following syntax to inherit a base class into the derived class.Inheritance is an important aspect of the object-oriented paradigm. Inheritance provides code reusability to the program because we can use an existing class to create a new class instead of creating it from scratch.\n",

    "#### Types Of Inheritance :\n",
    " * Single Inheritance: \n",
    "Single inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from a single parent class, thus enabling code reusability and the addition of new features to existing code.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Multiple Inheritance: \n",
    "When a class can be derived from more than one base class this type of inheritance is called multiple inheritances. In multiple inheritances, all the features of the base classes are inherited into the derived class. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Multilevel Inheritance :\n",
    "In multilevel inheritance, features of the base class and the derived class are further inherited into the new derived class. This is similar to a relationship representing a child and a grandfather. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Hierarchical Inheritance: \n",
    "When more than one derived class are created from a single base this type of inheritance is called hierarchical inheritance. In this program, we have a parent (base) class and two child (derived) classes.\n",

    "* Hybrid Inheritance: \n",
    "Inheritance consisting of multiple types of inheritance is called hybrid inheritance."
