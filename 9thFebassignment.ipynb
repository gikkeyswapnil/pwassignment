    "  * In Python, getters and setters are methods that allow you to retrieve and modify the values of an object's attributes. Getters are used to retrieve the values of an object's attributes, while setters are used to modify those values.The use of getters and setters is a way to encapsulate the internal representation of an object's attributes, and to control how they are accessed and modified. This can be useful in many situations, such as when you want to enforce certain rules or constraints on the values of an object's attributes, or when you want to add some additional behavior whenever an attribute is accessed or modified."
