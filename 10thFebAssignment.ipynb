    "### Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",

    "\n",
    "The name of the file you want to open\n",
    "The mode in which you want to open the file\n",
    "* There are several modes in which you can open a file in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 1. 'r' (read-only mode): This mode is used when you just want to read the contents of a file. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 1. 'w' (write mode): This mode is used when you want to write to a file. If the file already exists, its contents will be truncated, and if it does not exist, a new file with that name will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 'a' (append mode): This mode is used when you want to append data to the end of an existing file. If the file does not exist, a new file with that name will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 'x' (exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to create a new file, but only if the file does not already exist. If the file already exists, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 'b' (binary mode): This mode is used when you want to work with binary data, such as images or executable files. The 'b' mode can be combined with any of the other modes. For example, 'wb' means write mode in binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 't' (text mode): This mode is used when you want to work with text data. The 't' mode is the default mode when you don't specify any mode. The 't' mode can be combined with any of the other modes. For example, 'rt' means read-only mode in text"

    "### Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "#### Anss:\n",
    "The close() function is used to close a file in Python. It's important to close a file after you're done with it because when a file is open, it takes up system resources, such as memory and file descriptors. If you don't close the file, these resources will remain occupied even after your program has finished using the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, if you're working with the file in write mode, any changes you make to the file won't be saved until you close the file. This can lead to data loss if your program crashes or is interrupted before the file is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Closing a file also helps ensure that the file is properly flushed to disk and any buffered data is written to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good practice to use the with statement when working with files. The with statement automatically closes the file for you when you're done with it, so you don't have to worry about forgetting to close the file manually."

    "The with statement is used in combination with the open() function to provide a convenient and safe way to manage file I/O in Python.\n",
    "When you use the with statement, Python will automatically handle the file I/O for you, even if an exception is raised within the block. This is because the with statement sets up a context in which the file is automatically closed when the block of code is exited, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. This helps to prevent resource leaks, where the file is left open and its contents cannot be written to or read from because the file handle is already in use."
